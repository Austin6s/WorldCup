## World Cup Data Exploration

### Date created
August 14th, 2021

### Required Software and Packages
Postgres SQL --version 13

### Description
In this project, I used world cup data to explore some interesting facts about the world cup. I am a big sports fan so I did this project simply because I found it interesting.

I answered four questions with four SQL queries and then made a visualization for each in Tableau. The first visual is a bar graph showing the attendance for each world cup. The second is a line graph of goals scored in each world cup by the top ten all-time goal scoring countries. The third is another bar graph representing the number of finals appearances for the top countries. The last visual is a map showing the number of all-time goals scored by each country.
